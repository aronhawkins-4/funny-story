Once there was a man named George who loved musik.
He loved driving in his Porsche to Berlin.
He also loved driving his Audi around Munich.
One time, he drove so fast his lederhose flew right off!
I grabbed a gabaeck at the Flughafen.
I prefer the baeckerei in the flughafen compared to the ones in Munich. My hund would agree. My hund loves to eat bratwurst, by the way.
